tweet-planet-reports

Script to tweet a report with the contributions of a RSS Planet. I used it for the planet planetasysadmin.com
There are some variables you may want to change on the script before use it, like the consumer and access token keys for your twitter account if you want to use, there are well documented on the script on the "VARIABLES" section.
The script will needs the next perl modules, you should install it from cpan or your package provider:
